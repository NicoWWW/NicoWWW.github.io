> In a world consumed by a catastrophic virus, death is no longer the end. The infected are cursed with regeneration, each revival eroding their memories, their reason, their humanity. You awaken after an endless sleep, alone, with the power to return from death intact. Believing your gift to be the key to restoring the ruined world, you set out to undo the devastation. But every sacrifice strips away another piece of who you are. The further you fight, the more you lose—until you no longer recognize friend from foe, or even yourself.

*The End* is a 2D Action-Platformer in which you awaken in a ruined world ravaged by a mind-eroding virus. Cursed with the ability to fully regenerate after death, you must fight through relentless enemies and monstrous bosses, sacrificing yourself again and again to push forward. Each death revives your body but strips away fragments of your memories, blurring the line between heroism and self-destruction. Traverse decayed suburbs, desolate cities, and the apocalyptic lab at the heart of it all, uncovering the truth behind your power and the friends you may already have lost.

# Engineering Highlights 

* Boss AI & Combat Logic

Approach: Hierarchical state machines (C#) with ScriptableObject configs for attacks (windup, active, recovery, i-frames, stamina cost, damage, knockback).

Targeting & Timing: Raycast/overlap checks for range; cooldowns and animation events to sync hit frames with VFX/SFX.

<hr>

* UI Systems

Tutorial UI: Built pop-up prompts and on-screen instructions to teach movement, combat, and mechanics.

HUD & Combat UI: Implemented the boss HP bar and feedback indicators to clearly communicate combat state to the player.

Menus: Designed and coded the main menu and pause menu, including navigation, settings, and scene transitions.

<hr>

* Gameplay Interaction Framework

Reusable Triggers: OnEnter/OnExit/OnUse events invoking lists of actions (toggle door, spawn wave, play cutscene, set checkpoint).

Data-oriented Setup: Prefabs + ScriptableObject configs so designers (or me) could assemble encounters quickly.

# Art Contributions

Produced the majority of the game’s visual assets, including background art, UI elements, and several cutscene illustrations that supported narrative delivery.
