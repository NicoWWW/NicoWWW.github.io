> A single mom with two kids tours a house for sale that was owned by a painter who died. Lonely and tormented, the ghost of the painter sucks the family into her paintings so that she will not be alone forever.

*Art House* is a 2D Puzzle-Platformer game in which you get trapped inside of paintings and must utilize the paintings’ layers in order to avoid demons and obstacles to escape with your children. Explore the fantastical, beautiful worlds of paintings and use the unique mechanic of rapidly switching between the paintings’ layers - background, midground, foreground - to complete traversal puzzles.
