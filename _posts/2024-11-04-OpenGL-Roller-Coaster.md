**Development** : C++, OpenGL Core Profile

**Year** : 2024

* Developed an immersive roller coaster simulation using C++ and OpenGL Core Profile with Catmull-Rom splines to render realistic track curves
* Implemented multiple shaders, including Phong shading for per-pixel lighting and texture mapping for ground realism, enabling a dynamic first-person camera view
* Built user controls for interactive "rides" along the track while applying shader-based lighting and texture techniques for enhanced scene fidelity, adhering to modern OpenGL rendering standards
