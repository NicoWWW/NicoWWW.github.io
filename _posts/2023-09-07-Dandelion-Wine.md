Dandelion Wine is a Whimsical Slapstick Combat Game for Mobile Audiences, developed in Unity with a 30-person multidisciplinary game team as part of a year-long advanced game project. The game narrative is based on the Roman/Geek mythology, inviting players play as a mischievous glob of wine wreaking havoc at a cult festival, solve puzzles to grow bigger, and build an army of tipsy Winefolk to defeat the ultimate Wine God.

My Focus:
· Applied and fine-tuned Zibra Liquids to create liquid simulation as the main player character
· Created realistic environments and implemented dynamic lighting with fog effects to enhance game realism
· Partnered closely with art and engineering teams to optimize art assets for performace and troubleshoot game texturing and real-time rendering issues
