Mom told me that the first time I picked up pencil, I didn't like painting at all. It was five years old. However, I didn't remember it at all either, since it is also hard to tell exactly when or why I started to like painting in my . Ever since I could remember, as long as there is pen and paper besides my hands, I couldn't help to developing dots to lines, lines to spaces, then faces and more.
