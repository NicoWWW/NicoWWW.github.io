>Mom told me that the first time I picked up pencil, I didn't like painting at all. It was five years old. However, I didn't remember it at all either, since it is also hard to tell exactly when or why I started to like painting in my . Ever since I could remember, as long as there is pen and paper besides my hands, I couldn't help to developing dots to lines, lines to spaces, then faces and more.

These are all works created during my eight years old, when flowers were not flowers and crowd was not crowd for me. I saw only red road thick with black, yellow or white shapes, like a mass of ants crawling in summer. World was not world; it was art. However, I should not know what art is at that time.

I tried more different painting styles when getting older and went to art studio for professional study. During my five years there, I confirmed my strong interest in expressing my emotions and feelings through pictorial tension by lines. I am fascinated by elaborately carving the outline of people's faces or sketching the passing of clouds through strong or weak stroke of the brush on my hand. Until then, I started to realize that painting has been a kind of muscle memory for me, as I was born for it.

I belive painting exists for my random but romantic interest, but my interests are not only there for myself. I would like to use the colorful world created under my pen to bring happiness to others, becoming other more meanings. I hoppe one day, people can appreciate or critize my artworks, but more importantly, they can hear my voice from my strokes kissing the board. I think I will keep drawing forever.
