> Mom once told me that when I first picked up a pencil at the age of five, I wasn’t fond of painting at all. I don’t recall that moment, nor can I pinpoint exactly when or why my feelings about painting changed. What I do remember is that, as long as I could grasp a pen and paper, I was compelled to transform dots into lines, lines into shapes, and shapes into faces and beyond.

These works were all created when I was eight years old, a time when flowers weren't really flowers, and crowds weren’t just crowds. To me, the world was a canvas where red roads thickened with black, yellow, or white shapes, resembling a swarm of ants in summer. The world was not merely a place—it was art, even though I couldn't have known what art was at that age.

As I grew older, I explored various painting styles and studied professionally at an art studio for five years. During that time, I solidified my passion for conveying emotions and feelings through the tension of lines. I became captivated by the intricate process of shaping people’s faces or capturing the movement of clouds with bold or delicate brushstrokes. It was then that I came to understand that painting was more than just an activity for me—it was a deeply ingrained part of who I am, almost like muscle memory.

I believe that painting exists for my spontaneous yet romantic interest, but my passion extends beyond just myself. I aim to use the vibrant worlds created under my pen to bring joy to others, imbuing my work with deeper meaning. I hope that one day people will not only appreciate or critique my artworks but also hear the voice of my strokes that kiss the canvas. I think I will keep drawing forever.
