### Experience Crafter


Since childhood, I¡¯ve always been inclined to wonder what others are thinking. What are you thinking about? Are you happy, or are you feeling sad? Everything has a cause and effect. Just as, rather than dressing up my Barbie dolls, I was more interested in taking apart their arms and legs¡ªI wanted to understand how everything worked. This fascination with the principles of cause and effect, combined with nearly two decades of insight into human emotions, drives me to perfect every detail in my designs. I know that when I create a game, I¡¯m not just making a game¡ªI¡¯m crafting a unique experience. I hope that everything I create can evoke joy, melancholy, fury, serenity, and a sense of liberation, just as I intend to convey.
