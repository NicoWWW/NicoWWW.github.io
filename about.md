Hello Wolrd!

I am Nicole Wang. I am also known by my Chinese name Rui Wang. I am a junior double majoring in Computer Science Games and Applied Mathematics at Univerity of Southern California.

More fun facts about me~ I have over 15 years of drawing experience and have stayed in an art studio for 5 years. But currently, I focus on anime-related creations for most of time.
